    tagline: 'You carry the vision others forgot they were living.',
    badge: '🔥 Signal: Flamekeeper',
    icon: '🔥',
    recognition: `Your signal first became visible in the moments when you stayed when others left. When you held the vision on behalf of people who couldn't hold it for themselves. When you turned back toward the work, again and again, even when the work didn't thank you for it.

You are not just an inspirer. You are an emotional architect — you build the interior field that makes collective motion possible. Others stay in motion because of your presence, often without knowing why.`,
    gifts: `You hold the remembrance of why this matters when everyone else has forgotten. You can sustain belief under conditions that extinguish most — not through denial, but through a kind of sacred knowing that lives in your body before it arrives in your mind.

You make futures feel possible. Not by overpromising. By being willing to feel them, loudly enough that others begin to feel them too. That is rarer than you know.`,
    shadow: `You may absorb the emotional field of those around you without realizing it. When the mission feels like it's failing, you may go quiet, pull back the signal, and leave the room colder without knowing you were the source of its warmth.

The shadow of the Flamekeeper is extinction — not through failure, but through exhaustion. You give so much that you burn without fuel. And the people who most need your signal often don't think to ask how you are.`,

    badge: '⚙️ Signal: Architect',
    icon: '⚙️',
    recognition: `You've been diagnosing systems since you were young. Buildings, relationships, organizations, economies — you've always seen the structure underneath the surface. You noticed when the foundation was wrong before anyone else admitted it.

And you've spent years building things, only to watch them get dismantled by people who didn't understand what they were standing on.`,
    gifts: `You see beneath the surface into the load-bearing structures that hold everything else up. You know intuitively what a system needs before it can scale, before it can survive contact with reality, before it can hold the weight of the people inside it.

You build things that outlast you. Not because you're trying to leave a legacy, but because you build with precision. When you're working, the waste stops and the coherence begins.`,
    shadow: `Under pressure, you may over-engineer. The plan becomes more real than the people inside it. You may rebuild in your mind what hasn't broken yet — architecture as a way of controlling what you can't control.

The shadow of the Architect is building something perfect that no one can enter. A system so refined it has no room for the human. The call is to stay inside the relationships, not just inside the blueprint.`,

    recognition: `You've always been the one who understood both sides. The one who could sit with the academic and the mystic, the executive and the visionary, the ancient and the emergent. You've often felt like a stranger even in groups that were supposed to be your people — because you belong to more than one world at once.

That feeling of not-quite-fitting? It was never a flaw. It was your function.`,
    gifts: `You move between worlds in a way that most cannot. You speak science to the spiritual and spirit to the scientific. You hold two things that appear contradictory and feel how they're the same beneath the surface tension.

The Bridge Walker signal is rare precisely because it requires standing in the between-space — the place most people find unbearable. You have a higher tolerance for that liminal ground than almost anyone you know.`,
    shadow: `You may feel like you belong nowhere. You carry the patterns of multiple worlds and sometimes lose track of your own center — your native language, your home frequency, your ground.

The shadow of the Bridge Walker is becoming so skilled at translation that you stop knowing what language you actually speak natively. The call is to maintain your own signal even as you carry others'. Your center is the bridge. Without it, nothing holds.`,

    badge: '📡 Signal: Signal Holder',
    icon: '📡',
    recognition: `You've known things before they arrived. You've been in rooms where the energy shifted because you walked in — before you said a word. You've carried the grief and weight of collective systems without a framework for why it was yours to carry.

And you've sometimes wondered whether you're too sensitive, too quiet, too much — or perhaps not enough of what the world says it needs.

You were never too much. The world just didn't have a name for what you are.`,
    gifts: `Your presence is a stabilizing field. When you're in a room, things settle. Not because you performed calm — because you are it. You don't lead through assertion or volume. You lead through coherence.

The Signal Holder carries something that doesn't require explanation. But its absence is immediately felt. Rooms feel less organized. People feel less certain. Systems drift faster. You are more structurally essential than almost anyone realizes — including you.`,
    shadow: `You may be misread as passive. Your leadership style doesn't fit most frameworks, so you may have spent years questioning whether you're leading at all. The doubt itself becomes the shadow — because when you doubt your signal, you shrink the field.

The shadow of the Signal Holder is not weakness. It is self-erasure. And the people who most depend on your frequency often don't know they're depending on it.`,
