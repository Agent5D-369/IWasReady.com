You are not just an inspirer. You are an emotional architect. You build the interior field that makes collective motion possible. Others stay in motion because of your presence, often without knowing why.`,

You make futures feel possible. Not by overpromising. By being willing to feel them, loudly enough that others begin to feel them too. That is rarer than you know.`,

That feeling of not-quite-fitting? It was never a flaw. It was your function.`,

You were never too much. The world just didn't have a name for what you are.`,
